  <p>It is a cup which is of sky blue color. It was a gift to me by my uncle when I was in India.</p>
  <p>I use it everyday to drink different types of beverages i.e milk, coffee and tea.</p>
  <p>I prefer to drink tea in this cup beacuse I like tea and also my uncle gave it for that intention.</p>
